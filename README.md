# Admissions Tracker

Welcome to the General Assembly Admissions Portal, a Team ACaDemiK original. The Portal is designed
so that three different types of people can interact with it:

* **Applicants:** Prospective students are able to visit the Portal and upload their application for
one of three immersive classes: Web Development, User Experience Design and Product Management. Applicants
may login after applying to check on the status of their applications

* **Admissions Officers:** Admissions officers can log in and select candidates for phone screens. During 
said phone screens, AOs can open up an admissions questionnaire where they can fill in information about the
applicant; the questionnaire also includes a timer that counts down from 10 minutes (the maximum time allowed) 
for an interview.
